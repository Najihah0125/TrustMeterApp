# Trust Meter Mobile Application - University Final Year Project

# Description
Developed an application called Trust Meter to help customers evaluate the trustworthiness of online sellers on Facebook and Instagram. Customers often rely on reviews, ratings and recommendations to make purchase decisions. However, the evaluations made are subjective and not based on experts’ calculations. Therefore, Trust Meter provide a set of criteria to calculate the trustworthiness of online sellers. Trust Meter is built using Flutter and Firebase Firestore. As a result, Trust Meter has proven that customers’ judgement is imprecise with only a 90% average accuracy result. Trust Meter also gains positive user experience in delivering functional, reliable and userfriendly features based on a conducted UEQ survey.
